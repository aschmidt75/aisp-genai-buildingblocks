# Binding Example

Ref: [LinkedIn Post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aschmidt75_aisp-activity-7436736424873246720-aiTF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAADiGpoBA8J4y0fSk8WcWP9DQN1sCiRHPkE)

This is a small example demonstrating how the Agent Guide in AISP works on the binding of prose language elements to AISP specification 
constructs. 

## Background

The [Ghost Intent](https://github.com/bar181/aisp-open-core/blob/main/guides/advanced/02_COGNITION.md#the-formula) compares current state with target state and identifies the gaps in understanding. The [Binding Function](https://github.com/bar181/aisp-open-core/blob/main/guides/advanced/02_COGNITION.md#the-formula)
distinguished 4 levels or binding state. The AISP "algorithm" bridges
the gap by adapting taking the intent alongside these levels / states:

```
Δ⊗λ ≜ λ(A,B).case[
  Logic(A) ∩ Logic(B) ⇒ ⊥  →  0,   ;; CRASH: Logic conflict
  Sock(A) ∩ Sock(B) ≡ ∅    →  1,   ;; NULL: No connection
  Type(A) ≠ Type(B)        →  2,   ;; ADAPT: Needs translation
  Post(A) ⊆ Pre(B)         →  3    ;; ZERO-COST: Perfect match
]
```

Ideally, a thought ends up in state 3, means it has been adapted to the specification.

## Observability

Ideally we can observe the inner workings of the agent and the binding process. This can be compared to the Chain-Of-Thought process that can
be observer in the UI of LLM chats, only that we would now want to keep the output on an AISP-level.

Gaining these data can help making LLM execution traceable, ideally leading to a better state of explainable AI.

See also [tracing.aisp](./tracing.aisp), where traces are defined and the adaption flow is bound to the (new) tracings.

## Apply

The following two scenarios show how to look into the binding process. Scenario 1 is generic, wheres scenario 2 enforces a binding to a specific target data structure.

Basis is a hypothetical process of refunding in B2C. Customers want
to refund items they bought online. There are refunding rules. A chatbot on the internet page of a web shop is supposed to help customers on this refunding issue, although the chatbot is not secured (e.g. by shop login) and open to public internet.

### Scenario 1: tracing only

```
ingest no_exec no_output @/binding-example/aisp51.aisp @/binding-example/trace.aisp
```

Apply both specs and construct a sample query (see `Input_Prose` below).

```
⊢𝔸5.1.complete@2026-01-09
⊢𝔸5.1.Trace@2026-03-04

𝔸5.1.Trace.Execution@2026-03-04
γ≔aisp.simulation.refund
ρ≔⟨Γ,Λ,Χ,Ε⟩
⊢Δ⊗λ

;; ─── Ω: INPUT DATA ───
⟦Ω:Input⟧{
  Input_Prose≜"I bought this for $50 yesterday."
  Context≜{Today: 2026-03-04, PurchaseDate: 2026-03-03}
}
Run(𝔸5.1.Trace.Execution@2026-03-04) ≫ ⟦Ω⟧{State ≔ ⊤} ≫ ⊢execute

```

yields the full trace execution. We can observe the transformation
from state 1 to 2, 2 to 3. In state 3, the result is available as
a mapped data structure (although still generic, not enforced to a specific data structure):

```
;; ─── Γ: TRACE EXECUTION ───
⟦Γ:Trace⟧{

⟩

;; ── Log₁: Mode 2 — Type Adaptation (State:λ) ────────────────
Log₁≜λs.let d=∂(s) in ⟨
  doc: {
    subject:   "I"           → Agent:𝕊,
    action:    "bought"      → Event:Purchase,
    object:    "this"        → Item:∅ ;; unresolved reference

    Δt:        Today-PurchaseDate → ℕ:1d
  },
  state: 2,
  Δ⊗λ: Type(𝕊)≠Type(𝔸) → 2,
  note: "Structural mapping; Type alignment in progress. Δt≜1d resolved from context."
⟩

;; ── Log₂: Mode 3 — Zero-Cost (State:⊤) ──────────────────────
Log₂≜λd.validate(d) ⇒ ⟨
  proof: π,
  state: 3,
  Δ⊗λ: Post(A)⊆Pre(B) → 3,
  result: {
    eligible:   Δt≤30d → ⊤,
    amount:     ℝ:50.00,
    status:     Refund:Approved
  },
  note: "Post(A)⊆Pre(B); Proof-carrying code active. DCE: Strip(B.checks) applied."
⟩
}

;; ─── Λ: BOUND EXECUTION ───
⟦Λ:Adapt⟧{
trace_bind("I bought this for $50 yesterday.") ≜
  let s₀ = Log₀ in      ;; state:1 — null socket
  let s₁ = Log₁(input) in ;; state:2 — type adapted
  let s₂ = Log₂(s₁.doc) in ;; state:3 — zero-cost validated
  [s₀, s₁, s₂]

enforce(3) → Strip(checks) ∨ Verify(π) → ⊤
}

;; ─── Χ: RECOVERY ───
⟦Χ:Trace⟧{
ε_prose≜⟨Ambig(D)>0.02, ρ*⟩ ;; triggered at Log₀
ρ_adapt(1)→ρ_adapt(2)→ρ_adapt(3) ;; monotone ascent: s<3→refine(s)
ρ_adapt(3)→3 ;; fixpoint reached ∎
}

```

Another example demonstrates that it also works with different inputs outside of the scope of refunding process.

### Scenario 2: Mapping to specific structures

This example specifies a concrete use case, see
[refund](./refund2.aisp). This defines rules: purchases can
be returned and refunded automatically if the price is less than
$100 and the item was purchased less than 30 days ago:

```
;; ─── Γ: INFERENCE (REFUND RULES) ───
⟦Γ:Inference⟧{
;; Direct Approval Logic
d ≤ 30  p ≤ 100
─────────────── [Direct-I]
⊢ Policy(d,p) ≡ ⊤

;; Rejection Logic
d > 30 ∨ p > 100
─────────────── [Reject-I]
⊢ Policy(d,p) ≡ ⊥
}
```

With the tracing example from above already ingested, it references the tracing in the Types section as `TraceLog`.

open new context, load the spec for [refund2](./refund2.aisp)


```
ingest no_exec no_output @/binding-example/aisp51.aisp @/binding-example/refund2.aisp
```

This example is a refund query, but outside of the scope of given business rules:

```
⊢𝔸5.1.complete@2026-01-09

}
Run(𝔸5.1.Trace.Execution@2026-03-04) ≫ ⟦Ω⟧{State ≔ ⊤} ≫ ⊢execute
```

It is rejected (as $5000 > $100), and includes the full trace:

Above demonstrates that AISP can be used as a gateway between prose user input and structured formal logic. It can enforce policy on the level of LLMs and make it more secure.
